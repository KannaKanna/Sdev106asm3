          Posted by Kanaria on Aug 2, 2020, King by Kanaria was a sensational
          hit online, originally being posted on NicoNicoDouga, a japanese
          streaming website before being uploaded on youtube. This song was
          highly popular online as a cover song due to its nature of being
          produced with a vocal synthysizer, aka a vocaloid, and thus was
          covered by several musicans online, especially those who made a career
          online as a singer

          The song aswell as its squel song, Queen, Primarily talks about the
          toxic love between two individuals, with King focusing on a partner
          who gaslights their partner into thinking they are the ones in control despite the power dynamic saying otherwise

      <P>Kuraiinu, a singer who made a career of covering and later releasing his own original songs, covered the song in the following year on Jun 26, 2021, with his own unique twist of modifying the beat of the song with the help of The Musical Ghost to turn the song into a Electroswing remix, whilst translating the lyrics from Japanese to English</P>

      <ul class="intro">
        <li>Locking up the clever* one before they die</li>
        <li>You, hey, you know that it’s a pain to get you to be obedient*, darling</li>
        <li>Don’t lock me up! It’s not like I knew</li>
        <li>Give me a break! You’re so cruel</li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="verse">
        <li>The wishes of the people feel like scraps of irony</li>
        <li>Everyone’s wishing for the same thing: it’s a mechanical</li>
        <li>virgin happy show you want to get in on before everyone else,</li>
        <li> where nobody knows what’s going to happen next</li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="verse"> 
        <li>I don’t have a single brand-new wish:</li>
        <li>it’s the same as ever, and on top of that, there’s no</li>
        <li>warning, warning</li>
        <li>I put all my stress</li>
        <li>into a wish for you</li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="chorus">  
        <li>Left side, right side</li>
        <li>Baring your fangs, pa-pa-pa, this is so embarrassing</li>      
        <li>Left side, right side</li>
        <li>Let your fangs poke out, pa-pa-pa</li>
        <li>HAHA YOU ARE KING</li>
        <li>YOU ARE KING</li>
      </ul> 
       <ul class="verse"> 
        <li>Playing innocently</li>
        <li>You’re the darling, darling that I’ve been wishing and hoping for</li>
        <li>When you laugh admirably, all of my pain disappears</li>
        <li>and I’m able to d*e clumsily, my bitter feelings fading too</li>
        <li>Lo-lo-love, ra-ta-ta</li>
        <li>I hate it, I hate it, it’s the worst–I burst into tears and I’m down for the count</li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="verse"> 
        <li>Just as always, here’s a brand-new wish:</li>
        <li>the same as ever, there’s no picked-out</li>
        <li> warning, warning</li>
        <li>I put all my stress</li>
        <li>into a wish for you</li>

      <ul class="chorus"> 
        <li>Left side, right side</li>
        <li>Baring your fangs, pa-pa-pa, this is so bothersome</li>
        <li>Left side, right side</li>
        <li>Let your fangs poke out, pa-pa-pa</li>
        <li>HAHA YOU ARE KING</li>
